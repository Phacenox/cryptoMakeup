{Some;More}
 efficient attacks 
{are possible;can be found}
 by 
{employing;applying}
 cryptanalysis to 
{specific;certain}
 hash functions. When a collision attack is 
{realized;discovered}
 and is found to be 
{faster;more efficient}
 than a birthday attack, 
{a;the}
 hash function is often denounced as 
{"broken".;"cracked".}
 The NIST hash function competition was 
{largely;mostly}
 induced by published collision attacks 
{against;targeting}
 two very commonly used hash functions, MD5 and SHA-1. The collision attacks 
{against;targeting}
 MD5 have improved so much that, as of 2007, it 
{takes;can take}
 just a few seconds on a regular computer. Hash collisions 
{created;implemented}
 this way are usually constant 
{length;size}
 and largely unstructured, so cannot directly be 
{applied;used}
 to attack 
{widespread;widely used}
 document formats or protocols.
